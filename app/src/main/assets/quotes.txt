When you have a dream, you’ve got to grab it and never let go.
Nothing is impossible. The word itself says ‘I’m possible!
There is nothing impossible to they who will try.
The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot.
Life has got all those twists and turns. You’ve got to hold on tight and off you go.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.
You define your own life. Don’t let other people write your script.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
Do not allow people to dim your shine because they are blinded. Tell them to put some sunglasses on.
You don’t always need a plan. Sometimes you just need to breathe, trust, let go and see what happens.
You can be everything. You can be the infinite amount of things that people are.
